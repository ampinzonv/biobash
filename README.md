## BIOBASH Vb0.1
Bogot√° - Colombia Octubre 4 2020

BIOBASH is a set of BASH scripts useful for common bioinformatics related tasks.
It was born by our group's necessity on performing simple rutinary tasks while working
on bioinformatics data analysis.
Therefore, the scripts cover different tasks that are not necessarily "bioinformatics" tasks (although there are some),
but "bioinformatics-related" tasks, such as data manipulation, data filtering and organization etc.

This project started as a weekend exercises in 2015 and then was kind of abandoned for several years (although the scripts developed
have shown to be useful during thiese years also!!!) and now we are re-taking this project and seeing how far it goes.

As for this release there are 10 functions (scripts) in the following categories:


### FASTA ANALYSIS AND MANIPULATION
* bb_count_seqs
* bb_extract_fasta_entry
* bb_get_fasta_headers
* bb_remove_fasta_header
* bb_count_residues
* bb_get_GC_content

### LISTS AND GENERAL FILE MANIPULATION
* bb_dos2unix
* bb_get_freq_from_list
* bb_get_nr_list
* bb_remove_empty_lines

By default calling any script without arguments will show help menu.
