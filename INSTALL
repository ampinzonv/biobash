BIOBASH INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Just run the "installbiobash" script and follow the instructions.
By default it attempts to install the scripts in: /usr/local/bin
so you will need privileges to write in that path.

UNINSTALL BIOBASH
Just run the bb_uninstall_biobash script and follow the instructions.
