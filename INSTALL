BIOBASH INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Just run the "installbiobash" script.
By default it attempts to install the scripts in: /usr/local/bin
so you will need privileges to write in that path.
As for this version if you want to change the install script please
modify the corresponding line in the script.
