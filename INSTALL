BIOBASH Vb0.1
Bogot√° - Colombia March 17th 2015

The best way to install BB is sourcing it in, for example, your ".bash_profile"
adding the following line to the file .bash_profle in your home:

source /path/to/biobashvb0.1.sh

By doing this all the BB functions will be available for your use. It is possible that
the functions won't be able inmediately in the already opened shell. So close your shell 
and open it again. It should work. Just typing"bb_" (without quotes) and hitting the TAB 
key will display all the available functions.

If you want BB to be available to all users you can sourced it in a system wide config 
file (i.e. /etc/profile). Ask your system administrator.
